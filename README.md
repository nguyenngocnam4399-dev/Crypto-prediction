# 1️⃣ Introduction

This project designs a structured, scalable, and empirically testable quantitative trading research framework. It standardizes the full lifecycle of a trading signal—from real-time market ingestion, technical indicator computation, news sentiment modeling, metric abstraction, to deterministic prediction and independent confirmation—while strictly separating processing layers to prevent data leakage.

Instead of relying on opaque machine learning models, the system implements a weighted, metric-driven scoring engine based on the concept of **edge**, allowing transparent evaluation of directional dominance between buyers and sellers. The architecture follows a fact-driven Data Warehouse design with explicit grain definition, idempotent ETL processes, and full signal traceability. Structural pattern mining (FP-Growth) is applied to validated trades to assess edge sustainability. The framework prioritizes transparency, reproducibility, and experimental rigor over short-term optimization.

# 3️⃣ System Architecture

![System Architecture](images/System_Architecture.png)

The system follows a layered architecture separating ingestion, transformation, signal modeling, orchestration, validation, and analytics.

---

## 1. Data Ingestion

### Market Data
- Kafka streams real-time OHLCV data  
- Spark Streaming normalizes records  
- Stored in `fact_kline`  

### News Data
- News crawled from crypto media sources  
- Sent to Kafka topic  
- Consumed and stored in `news_fact`  
- Symbol mapping stored in `news_coin_fact`  

Both streams remain independent and immutable.

---

## 2. Indicator Computation

- Atomic indicators computed via Spark  
- Stored in `fact_indicator`  
- Partitioned by symbol and interval  
- Fully recomputable from raw kline  

---

## 3. News Sentiment Processing

News sentiment is modeled as a multi-layer fact pipeline:

### Raw Layer — `news_fact`
Grain: 1 row = 1 article  
- title  
- url (UNIQUE)  
- sentiment_score  
- created_date  
- view_number  
- tag_id  

### Mapping Layer — `news_coin_fact`
Grain: `(news_id, symbol_id)`  
- symbol attribution  
- confidence score  

### Weighted Layer — `news_sentiment_weighted_fact`
Grain: `(news_id, symbol_id)`  

Includes:
- raw_sentiment  
- tag_weight  
- confidence  
- weighted_score  
- final_score  
- event_time  

Constraints:
- UNIQUE(news_id, symbol_id)  
- Indexed for join optimization  

### Aggregated Layer — `news_sentiment_agg_fact`
Grain: `(symbol_id, window_start)`  

- news_count  
- sentiment_weighted  

Aligned to trading interval resolution.

## 4. Metric Abstraction

- Trading conditions defined in `dim_metric`  
- Technical + sentiment metrics supported  
- Evaluated into `fact_metric_value`  
- Threshold, trend, cross, volatility logic  

---

## 5. Prediction Engine

buy_score  = Σ(weighted BUY metrics)  
sell_score = Σ(weighted SELL metrics)  

edge = |buy_score − sell_score|  
confidence = max(score) / MAX_SCORE  

Stored in `fact_prediction`.

Deterministic, explainable, leakage-safe.

---

## 6. Backtesting & Confirmation

- Adaptive TP/SL  
- Controlled lookahead  
- Results stored in `fact_prediction_result`  
- Strict separation from prediction  

---

## 7. Orchestration Layer (Apache Airflow)

- DAG-based workflow control  
- Spark job scheduling  
- Metric & sentiment pipelines  
- Retry & failure handling  
- CeleryExecutor for distributed tasks  

Runs on Linux-based infrastructure.

---

## 8. Analytics & Pattern Mining

- Win Rate  
- Expectancy  
- Rolling stability  
- Equity curve  
- Drawdown  
- FP-Growth structural validation  

---

# 4️⃣ Data Warehouse Design

![Warehouse ERD](images/warehouse_schema.png)

Fact-driven layered warehouse with explicit grain definition.

## Core Dimensions
- `dim_symbol`
- `dim_interval`
- `dim_indicator_type`
- `dim_metric`

## Market Fact Tables

| Table | Grain | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| `fact_kline` | (symbol, interval, close_time) | Market data |
| `fact_indicator` | (symbol, interval, indicator, timestamp) | Atomic signals |
| `fact_metric_value` | (symbol, interval, metric, calculating_at) | Conditions |
| `fact_prediction` | (symbol, interval, predicting_at) | Hypothesis |
| `fact_prediction_result` | (prediction_id) | Realized outcome |

## News Fact Tables

| Table | Grain | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| `news_fact` | (id) | Raw articles |
| `news_coin_fact` | (news_id, symbol_id) | Symbol mapping |
| `news_sentiment_weighted_fact` | (news_id, symbol_id) | Weighted sentiment |
| `news_sentiment_agg_fact` | (symbol_id, window_start) | Aggregated sentiment |

Design Principles:
- Explicit grain  
- Idempotent ETL  
- Event-time alignment  
- No cross-layer coupling  
- Fully traceable lifecycle

# 11️⃣ Conclusion

This project establishes a deterministic quantitative research infrastructure grounded in structured data modeling and strict leakage control.

By decoupling ingestion (market & news), signal construction, confirmation, and evaluation into independent layers, the system enforces reproducibility, auditability, and disciplined experimentation. Every stage of the signal lifecycle—technical and sentiment—is persisted at explicit grain within a fact-driven warehouse.

The architecture is designed as a scalable research foundation capable of extending toward:

- Portfolio-level allocation models  
- Transaction cost integration  
- Regime-adaptive weighting  
- Hybrid deterministic–statistical extensions  

The objective is not short-term optimization, but the construction of a controlled environment where edge can be measured, validated, and stress-tested under reproducible conditions.
