# 🌍 Market Context & Real-World Demand

In recent years, digital assets such as BTC, ETH, and BNB have increasingly become highly liquid asset classes attracting both retail and institutional investors. However, the cryptocurrency market is characterized by high volatility, strong sensitivity to news, and frequent short-term signal noise. Most trading decisions are still based on intuition or fragmented observations, lacking a systematic quantitative framework capable of long-term validation and performance evaluation.

As digital assets gain wider adoption and regulatory attention, the demand for a transparent, real-time data analytics platform with statistical grounding becomes increasingly critical. Such a system must not only continuously collect and process data but also organize it under a standardized Data Warehouse architecture, build a deterministic scoring framework, and evaluate strategies through traceable performance metrics.

This project was developed to address that challenge. Instead of focusing solely on short-term prediction, the system is designed as a complete data infrastructure — from ingestion, distributed processing, structured storage, modeling, to performance validation — delivering quantitative insights that are verifiable and scalable.

# 2️⃣ Data Warehouse Architecture

After defining the overall system architecture, the most critical step is designing the Data Warehouse to ensure structured, scalable data organization.

## 🧱 2.1 Dim–Fact Model

### 🎯 Design Principles

- Clearly define **Data Grain** for each fact table  
- Separate Context (Dimension) from Event (Fact)  
- Ensure extensibility when adding assets or new metrics  
- Optimize analytical queries over time  

---

## 📌 2.2 Core Fact Design

![Warehouse Schema](images/warehouse_schema_crypto.png)

### `fact_kline`
- Grain: (symbol_id, interval_id, open_time)  
- Stores normalized OHLCV market data  

### `fact_indicator`
- Grain: (symbol_id, interval_id, indicator_type_id, open_time)  
- Stores atomic indicator values  

### `fact_metric_value`
- Grain: (symbol_id, metric_id, open_time)  
- Stores evaluated trading conditions  

### `fact_prediction`
- Grain: (symbol_id, interval_id, signal_time, signal_type)  
- Stores BUY/SELL/SIDEWAY signals  

### `fact_prediction_result`
- Separated from prediction to ensure:
  - No data leakage  
  - Leakage-safe backtesting  
  - Clear separation between signal generation and validation

## 📰 2.3 Multi-Layer Sentiment Pipeline

![News Warehouse Schema](images/warehouse_schema_news.png)

Sentiment processing is structured into four layers:

1. `news_fact` (Raw Article)  
2. `news_coin_fact` (Symbol Mapping)  
3. `news_sentiment_weighted_fact` (Weighted Score)  
4. `news_sentiment_agg_fact` (Window Aggregation)  

This design ensures:

- Traceability from aggregated data back to raw source  
- Recomputability when weighting logic changes  
- Clear separation of processing responsibilities  

---

## Why Dim–Fact?

- Separation of context and events  
- Optimized analytical queries  
- Clear historical storage  
- Easy extensibility for new metrics  
- Alignment with standard Data Warehouse practices  
- Time-series and asset-level analytical support  

---

- Retry policies  
- Failure recovery  
- Isolated job execution  

Design ensures:

- A failed job does not crash the entire system  
- Re-execution without duplicate data  

---

# 5️⃣ Data Understanding (EDA) & Data Dictionary Reasoning

Data collection is grounded not only in technical design but also in market structure and behavioral dynamics.

## 🔹 Market Data (OHLCV)

| Field | Reason for Collection | Role in Model |
|-------|----------------------|---------------|
| Open / Close | Identify candle structure | Measure momentum |
| High / Low | Measure price range | Analyze volatility |
| Volume | Measure capital flow strength | Signal confirmation |
| Timestamp | Time-based analysis | Regime detection |

OHLCV forms the foundation of all technical analysis. Without proper timeframe normalization, indicators lose meaning.

---

## 🔹 Momentum Indicators (RSI, MACD)

### RSI
- Measures overbought/oversold conditions  
- Detects potential reversals  

### MACD
- Measures moving average convergence/divergence  
- Detects momentum shifts  

---

## 🔹 Trend Indicators (EMA, ADX)

### EMA
- EMA200: Long-term trend  
- EMA20/50: Mid/short-term trend  

### ADX
- Measures trend strength  
- Differentiates trending vs. sideways markets  

---

## 🔹 Volatility Indicators (BB, ATR)

Crypto markets exhibit:

- Volatility squeeze  
- Volatility expansion  

Bollinger Bands measure band width; ATR supports stop-loss calibration.

---

## 🔹 Volume-Based Metrics

- Volume divergence → weakening trend  

---

## 🔹 News & Sentiment

Crypto reacts strongly to:

- Regulation  
- ETF approvals  
- Exchange hacks  
- Macro events  

Sentiment complements technical scoring.
