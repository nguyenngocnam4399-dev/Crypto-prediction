# 1️⃣ Introduction

This project designs a structured, scalable, and empirically testable quantitative trading research framework. It standardizes the full lifecycle of a trading signal—from real-time market ingestion, technical indicator computation, and metric abstraction, to deterministic prediction and independent confirmation—while strictly separating processing layers to prevent data leakage.

Instead of relying on opaque machine learning models, the system implements a weighted, metric-driven scoring engine based on the concept of **edge**, allowing transparent evaluation of directional dominance between buyers and sellers. The architecture follows a fact-driven Data Warehouse design with explicit grain definition, idempotent ETL processes, and full signal traceability. Structural pattern mining (FP-Growth) is applied to validated trades to assess edge sustainability. The framework prioritizes transparency, reproducibility, and experimental rigor over short-term optimization.

The system follows a layered architecture separating ingestion, transformation, signal modeling, orchestration, validation, and analytics.

---

## 1. Data Ingestion

- Kafka streams real-time OHLCV market data  
- Spark Streaming processes and normalizes records  
- Clean data stored in `fact_kline`  

---

## 2. Indicator Computation

- Atomic indicators computed via Spark  
- Stored independently in `fact_indicator`  
- Partitioned by symbol and interval  

---

## 3. Metric Abstraction

- Trading conditions defined in `dim_metric`  
- Evaluated into `fact_metric_value`  
- Threshold, trend, cross, volatility logic  

---

## 4. Prediction Engine

- Independent BUY / SELL scoring  
- Edge and confidence calculation  
- Stored in `fact_prediction`  

---

## 5. Backtesting & Confirmation

- Adaptive TP/SL within controlled lookahead  
- Stored in `fact_prediction_result`  
- Strict leakage prevention  

---

## 6. Orchestration Layer (Apache Airflow)

The entire workflow is coordinated using **Apache Airflow DAGs** running in a Linux environment.

- Dependency-controlled Spark job execution  
- Scheduled metric, prediction, and confirmation tasks  
- Retry and failure handling  
- Modular DAG structure  
- CeleryExecutor for distributed execution  

Airflow ensures reproducible, production-ready orchestration across all pipeline layers.

# 11️⃣ Conclusion

This project establishes a deterministic quantitative research infrastructure grounded in structured data modeling and strict leakage control.

By decoupling ingestion, signal construction, confirmation, and evaluation into independent layers, the system enforces reproducibility, auditability, and disciplined experimentation. Every stage of the signal lifecycle is persisted at explicit grain within a fact-driven warehouse, reducing ambiguity and preventing implicit assumptions.

The framework is designed as a foundation rather than a single strategy implementation. Its architecture allows controlled expansion toward portfolio-level allocation models, transaction cost integration, regime-adaptive signal weighting, and hybrid deterministic–statistical extensions, while preserving transparency and structural integrity.

The primary objective is not short-term optimization, but the construction of a research environment where edge can be measured, validated, and stress-tested under controlled conditions.
